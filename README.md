# 👋🏼 Hello, world! 

## About me 🤓
My name is Chanel Chinedu, I’m a self-taught Software Developer who is passionate about programming and is growing a deep interest in both front-end and back-end development. Currently, I’m homeschooled. I’m not attending to any university. But, I've completed a 1-year level 5 QQI course in Computer Science (Software Development) and I’ve earned 6 distinctions in programming modules. The other two subjects, Communications and Work Experience were not coding related. I hope to attend to university next year to study Computer Science. 
I'm also studying the Korean. I have studied Korean since 2020, but I'm still not good at it ;-;. 

## Hobbies 💫
During my free time, I play video games.. a lot xD. I play most of the time: 
- Final Fantasy
- Left 4 Dead 2
- Sonic (I'm a huge fan of Sonic since I was born xD).

I play sometimes:
- Valorant
- Call Of Duty
- Minecraft
- Roblox
I used to play Pokemon but I rarely play it now ;-;.

I love spending my precious time with my important people. 
In my free time, I also learn Korean ^v^. 
And of course, programming is one of my top favorite hobbies to do too ᯓ★.

## Experience 🤔
Unfortunately, I didn’t attend to any internships or hackathons. But I did build a website for a small mechanic company, where I did my work experience for two weeks. (I will be building more projects xD loading...)
