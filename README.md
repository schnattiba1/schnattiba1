# 👋🏼 Hello, world! 

## About me 🤓
My name is Chanel Chinedu, I'm a self-taught developer who has been learning how to code since 2020 at the age of 12 years old.
I've been homeschooled since 2020, but has pursued a level 5 QQI certificate in Computer Science at Pearse College of Further Education. I am a prospective student preparing to begin my university studies in Computer Science.

As someone who is an aspiring Software Engineer, I love solving real-world problems and building software applications that help us improve our lives and make our lives much easier. I'm also interested in Cybersecurity - Security Engineering, where they secure data and networks from cyber-threats, vulnerabilities and attacks.

## Experience 🤔
Unfortunately, I didn’t attend to any internships or hackathons. But I did build a website for a small mechanic company, where I did my work experience for two weeks! - I'll be building more projects! Loading... xD
