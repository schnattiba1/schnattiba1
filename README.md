# 👋🏼 Hello, world! 

## About me 🤓
My name is Chanel Chinedu, I’m a self-taught software developer who is passionate about programming and is growing a deep interest in both front-end and back-end web development. Currently, I’m homeschooled. I’m not attending to a university, but I have completed a 1-year level 5 QQI course in computer science (software development) and I’ve earned 6 distinctions in programming modules. The other two subjects, Communications and Work Experience were not coding related. I hope to attend to university next year to study computer science. 

## Experience 🤔
Unfortunately, I didn’t attend to any internships or hackathons. But I did build a website for a small mechanic company, where I did my work experience for two weeks. (I will be building more projects xD loading...)
